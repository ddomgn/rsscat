    <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/minifree-libreboot-x200-tablet-now-fsf-certified-to-respect-your-freedom</link>
    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Wednesday, May 30th, 2018 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today awarded Respects Your Freedom (RYF) certification to the Libreboot X200 Tablet, from Minifree Ltd. The RYF certification mark means that the product meets the FSF's standards in regard to users' freedom, control over the product, and privacy.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/ryf/x200_Tablet.jpg" alt="Libreboot X200 tablet" height="375" width="500" />

<p>This is the third device from <a href="https://minifree.org/">Minifree Ltd</a> to receive <a href="https://www.fsf.org/ryf">RYF certification</a>. The Libreboot X200 Tablet is a fully free laptop/tablet hybrid that comes with <a href="http://trisquel.info/">Trisquel</a> and <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a> pre-installed. The device is similar to the previously certified Libreboot X200 laptop, but with a built-in tablet that enables users to draw, sign documents, or make handwritten notes. Like all devices from Minifree Ltd., purchasing the Libreboot X200 Tablet helps to fund development of Libreboot, the free boot firmware that currently runs on all RYF-certified laptops. It may be purchased at <a href="https://minifree.org/product/libreboot-x200-tablet/">https://minifree.org/product/libreboot-x200-tablet/</a>, and comes with free technical support included.</p>
<p>"We need RYF-certified laptops of all shapes, sizes, and form factors, and for them to be available from multiple sources around the world so users have options. This is a welcome expansion of those options, as well as an opportunity for people to help unlock future possibilities by funding Libreboot development,"  said the FSF's executive director, John Sullivan.</p>
<p>"The Libreboot X200 Tablet is another great addition to the line-up of freedom respecting devices from Minifree, which has a long history of developing the software and tools that make RYF-certifiable devices possible," said the FSF's licensing &amp; compliance manager, Donald Robertson, III.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that the FSF is now endorsing yet another Minifree product. Minifree's mission is to provide affordable, libre systems that are easy to use and therefore accessible to the public. Minifree's purpose is to provide funding to the Libreboot project, supporting it fully, and I'm delighted to once again cooperate with the FSF on this most noble goal," said Leah Rowe, Founder &amp; CEO, Minifree Ltd.</p>

    <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/zerocat-chipflasher-board-edition-1-now-fsf-certified-to-respect-your-freedom</link>
    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, May 15th, 2018 -- The Free Software
Foundation (FSF) today awarded Respects Your Freedom (RYF) certification
to the Zerocat Chipflasher board-edition-1. The RYF certification mark
means that the product meets the FSF's standards in regard to users'
freedom, control over the product, and privacy.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/ryf/zerocat-chipflasher.jpg" alt="chipflasher in action" height="281" width="500" />

<p>This is the first device under The <a href="http://www.zerocat.org">Zerocat Label</a> to receive <a href="https://www.fsf.org/ryf">RYF
certification</a>. The Chipflasher enables users to flash devices such
as laptops, allowing them to replace proprietary software with free
software like <a href="https://libreboot.org/">Libreboot</a>. While users are able to purchase
RYF-certified laptops that already come with Libreboot pre-loaded, for
the first time ever they are capable of freeing their own laptops using
an RYF-certified device. The Zerocat Chipflasher board-edition-1 is
now available for purchase as a limited edition at
<a href="http://www.zerocat.org/shop-en.html">http://www.zerocat.org/shop-en.html</a>. These first ten limited edition
boards are signed by Kai Mertens, chief developer of The Zerocat Label,
and will help to fund additional production and future development of
RYF-certified devices.</p>
<p>"The certification of the Zerocat Chipflasher is a big step forward for
the Respects Your Freedom program. Replacing proprietary boot firmware
is one of the first tasks for creating a laptop that meets RYF's
criteria, and now anyone can do so for their own devices with a flasher
that is itself RYF-certified," said the FSF's executive director, John
Sullivan.</p>
<p>An RYF-certified flashing device could also help to grow the number of
laptops available via the RYF program.</p>
<p>"When someone sets out to start their own business selling RYF-certified
devices, they now have a piece of hardware they can trust to help them with
that process. We hope to see even more laptops made available under the
program, and having those laptops flashed with a freedom-respecting
device will help to set those retailers on the right path from the
start," said the FSF's licensing &amp; compliance manager, Donald Robertson,
III.</p>
<p>"Free software tools carry the inherent message 'Let’s help our
neighbors!', as this is basically the spirit of the licenses that these
tools are shipped with. From a global perspective, we are all
'neighbors,' no matter which country. And from this point of view, I
would be happy if the flasher will be regarded as a contribution towards
worldwide cooperation and friendship," said Mertens.</p>

<h3>About The Zerocat Label</h3>
<p>The Zerocat Label has been set up in order to direct the focus on
free design hardware development.</p>
<p>The development of free designs for hardware has many benefits. One of
the most important is probably its capacity to conserve the Earth’s
resources, and those of people. When we share knowledge, we work towards
global solutions instead of individual profits.</p>
<p>Our current approach is to check which free design computer chips are
available today, and to start creating something useful with them, even
if bigger goals remain out of reach at this time. Creating tools in a
modular manner allows us to combine them and to achieve complex
solutions in the future.</p>
<p>Our next tasks are to find an answer to questions like “What free-design
tools do we need?” and “What are we able to accomplish right now?” We
hope to be able to build other free-design tools of wide interest by
answering those questions. It is an experimental endeavor.</p>

    <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/public-lab-and-karen-sandler-are-2017-free-software-awards-winners-1</link>
    <description></description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, USA – Saturday, March 24, 2018</strong> – The
  Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced the winners of the
  2017 Free Software Awards at a ceremony held during the LibrePlanet
  2018 conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  (MIT). FSF president Richard M. Stallman presented the Award for Projects of Social
  Benefit  and the Award for the Advancement of Free Software.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org/awards/sb-award/">Award for Projects of Social Benefit</a> is presented to a
project or team responsible for applying free software, or the ideas
of the free software movement, to intentionally and significantly
benefit society. This award stresses the use of free software in
service to humanity.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://publiclab.org/">Public Lab</a> received the award, which was accepted by
Liz Barry, Public Lab co-founder, organizer, and director of community
development, and Jeff Warren, Public Lab co-founder and research
director, on behalf of the entire Public Lab community.</p>
<p>Public Lab is a community and non-profit organization with the goal of
democratizing science to address environmental issues. Their
community-created tools and techniques utilize free software and
low-cost devices to enable people at any level of technical skill to investigate
environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Stallman noted how crucial Public Lab's work is to the global
community, and also how their use of free software is crucial to their
mission, saying that "the environmental and social problems caused by
global heating are so large that they cannot rationally be
denied. When studies concerning the causes and the effects of global
heating, or the environmental impact of pollution, industry, and
policy choices, are conducted using proprietary software, that is a
gratuitous obstacle to replicating them.</p>
<p>"Public Lab gets the tools to study and protect the world into
the hands of everyone -- and since they are free (libre) software,
they respect both the people who use them, and the community that
depends on the results."</p>
<p>Jeff Warren, speaking on behalf of the Public Lab community, added
that using free software is part of their larger mission to take
science out of the hands of the experts and allow everyday people to
participate: "At Public Lab, we believe that generating knowledge is a
powerful thing. We aim to open research from the exclusive hands of
scientific experts. By doing so, communities facing environmental
justice issues are able to own the science and advocate for the
changes they want to see.</p>
<p>"Building free software, hardware, and open data is
fundamental to our work in the Public Lab community, as we see it as a
key part of our commitment to equity in addressing environmental
injustice."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fsf.org/awards/fs-award">Award for the Advancement of Free Software</a> goes to an
individual who has made a great contribution to the progress and
development of free software, through activities that accord with the
spirit of free software.</p>
<p>This year, it was presented to Karen Sandler, the Executive Director
of the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a>, as well as a perennial
LibrePlanet speaker and friend to the FSF. She is known for her
advocacy for free software, particularly in relation to the software
on medical devices: she led an initiative advocating for free software
on implantable medical devices after exploring the issues surrounding
the software on her own implanted medical device (a defibrillator),
which regulates an inherited heart condition. Sandler has served as
the Executive Director of the GNOME Foundation, where she now serves
on the Board of Directors, and before that, she was General Counsel of
the Software Freedom Law Center. Finally, she co-organizes
<a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a>, the award-winning outreach program that organizes paid
internships in free software for people who are typically
underrepresented in these projects.</p>
<p>Stallman praised Sandler's dedication to free software, emphasizing
how sharing her personal experience has provided a window into the
importance of free software for a broader audience: "Her vivid warning
about backdoored nonfree software in implanted medical devices has
brought the issue home to people who never wrote a line of code.</p>
<p>"Her efforts, usually not in the public eye, to provide pro bono legal
advice to free software organizations and to organize infrastructure
for free software projects and copyleft defense, have been equally
helpful."</p>
<p>Sandler explained that her dedication to promoting free software was inevitable, given her personal experience: "Coming to terms with a dangerous heart condition should never have cost 
me fundamental control over the technology that my life relies on," she said. "The 
twists and turns of my own life, including my professional work at 
Conservancy, led me to understand how software freedom is essential to 
society. This issue is personal not just for me but for anyone who 
relies on software, and today that means every single person."</p>

    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, March 20, 2018 -- This
weekend, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Student
Information Processing Board (SIPB) at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) present the tenth annual
<a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/">LibrePlanet free software conference</a> in Cambridge, March
24-25, 2018, at MIT. LibrePlanet is an annual conference for
people who care about their digital freedoms, bringing together
software developers, policy experts, activists, and computer
users to learn skills, share accomplishments, and tackle
challenges facing the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> movement. LibrePlanet
2018 will feature sessions for all ages and experience levels.</p>
<p>LibrePlanet's tenth anniversary theme is "Freedom Embedded."
Embedded systems are everywhere, in cars, digital watches,
traffic lights, and even within our bodies. We've come to expect
that proprietary software's sinister aspects are embedded in
software, digital devices, and our lives, too: we expect that our
phones monitor our activity and share that data with big
companies, that governments enforce digital restrictions
management (DRM), and that even our activity on social Web sites
is out of our control. This year's <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/program/">talks and workshops</a> will
explore how to defend user freedom in a society reliant on
embedded systems.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include Benjamin Mako Hill, social scientist,
technologist, free software activist, and FSF board member, examining online
collaboration and free software; Electronic Frontier Foundation
senior staff technologist Seth David Schoen, discussing
engineering tradeoffs and free software; Deb Nicholson, community
outreach director for the Open Invention Network, talking about
the key to longevity for the free software movement; and Free
Software Foundation founder and president Richard Stallman,
looking at current threats to and opportunities for free
software, with a focus on embedded systems.</p>
<p>This year's LibrePlanet conference will feature over <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/program/">50
sessions</a>, such as <em>The battle to free the code at the
Department of Defense</em>, <em>Freedom, devices, and health</em>, and
<em>Standardizing network freedom</em>, as well as workshops on free
software and photogrammetry, digital music making, and desktops
for kids.</p>
<p>"For ten years, LibrePlanet has brought together free software
enthusiasts and newcomers from around the world to exchange
ideas, collaborate, and take on challenges to software freedom,"
said Georgia Young, program manager of the FSF. "But the
conference is not purely academic -- it works to build the free
software community, offering opportunities for those who cannot
attend to participate remotely by watching a multi-channel
livestream and joining the conversation online. And this year,
we're proud to offer several kid-friendly workshops, encouraging
earlier engagement with fun, ethical free software!"</p>
<p>Advance registration is closed, but attendees may register in
person at the event. Admission is gratis for FSF Associate
Members and students. For all other attendees, the cost of
admission is $60 for one day, $90 for both days, and includes
admission to the conference's social events. For those who cannot
attend, this year's sessions will be streamed at
<a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/live/">https://libreplanet.org/2018/live/</a>, and recordings will be
available after the event at <a href="https://media.libreplanet.org/">https://media.libreplanet.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Anthropologist and author Gabriella Coleman was scheduled to give
the opening keynote at LibrePlanet 2018, but was forced to
cancel.</p>
<h3>About LibrePlanet</h3>

    <description>The anonymous Pineapple Fund has donated $1 million worth of Bitcoin
to promote and defend free software, computer user freedom, and
digital rights.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, January 30, 2018 -- The Free
Software Foundation (FSF) announced it has received a record-breaking
charitable contribution of 91.45 Bitcoin from the Pineapple Fund,
valued at $1 million at the time of the donation. This gift is a

    <description>CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, January 16, 2018 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced the keynote speakers for LibrePlanet, the annual free software conference, taking place at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on Saturday, March 24 and Sunday, March 25, 2018.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The keynote speakers for the tenth annual <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/">LibrePlanet</a>
conference will be anthropologist and author Gabriella Coleman,
free software policy expert and community advocate Deb Nicholson,
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) senior staff technologist
Seth Schoen, and FSF founder and president Richard Stallman. <a href="https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&amp;id=71">Register for this year's conference here!</a></p>
<p>LibrePlanet is an annual conference for people who care about
their digital freedoms, bringing together software developers,
policy experts, activists, and computer users to learn skills,
share accomplishments, and tackle challenges facing the free
software movement. The theme of this year's conference is
Freedom. Embedded. In a society reliant on embedded systems -- in
cars, digital watches, traffic lights, and even within our bodies
-- how do we defend computer user freedom, protect ourselves
against corporate and government surveillance, and move toward a
freer world? LibrePlanet 2018 will explore these topics in sessions 
for all ages and experience levels.</p>
<p>Gabriella (Biella) Coleman is best known in the free software
community for her book <em>Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics
of Hacking</em>. Trained as an anthropologist, Coleman holds the
Wolfe Chair in Scientific and Technological Literacy at <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people-contacts/faculty/gabriella-coleman">McGill
University</a>. Her scholarship explores the intersection of the
<a href="http://culturedigitally.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Coleman-2016-Hacker-Digital-Keywords-Peters-ed.pdf">cultures of hacking and politics</a>, with a focus on the
sociopolitical implications of the free software movement and the
digital protest ensemble Anonymous, the latter in her book
<em>Hacker, Hoaxer, Whistleblower, Spy: The Many Faces of
Anonymous</em>.</p>
<p>Deb Nicholson is a free software policy expert and a passionate
community advocate, notably contributing to <a href="https://mediagoblin.org/">GNU MediaGoblin</a>
and <a href="https://openhatch.org/">OpenHatch</a>. She is the Community Outreach Director for
the <a href="https://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">Open Invention Network</a>, the world's largest patent
non-aggression community, which serves the kernel Linux, GNU,
Android, and other key free software projects. A perennial
speaker at LibrePlanet, this is Nicholson's first keynote at the
conference.</p>
<p>"They are all too modest to say it, but these speakers will blow
your mind," said FSF executive director John Sullivan. "Don't
miss this opportunity to hear about how technology controls our
core freedoms, how people are working together in communities to
build software that truly empowers, and how you can both benefit
from and contribute to these efforts."</p>
<p>Seth David Schoen has worked at the <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a> for over a decade,
creating the Staff Technologist position and helping other
technologists understand the civil liberties implications of
their work, helping EFF staff better understand technology
related to EFF's legal work, and helping the public understand
what the products they use really do. Schoen last spoke at
LibrePlanet in 2015, when he introduced <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>, the
automated, free software-based certificate authority.</p>
<p>FSF president <a href="https://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board">Richard Stallman</a> will present the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/awards">Free
Software Awards</a>, and discuss pressing threats and important
opportunities for software freedom. Dr. Richard Stallman launched
the free software movement in 1983 and started the development of
the GNU operating system (see www.gnu.org) in 1984. GNU is free
software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and redistribute
it, with or without changes. The GNU/Linux system, basically the
GNU operating system with Linux added, is used on tens of
millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace
Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic
Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the the Takeda Award for
Social/Economic Betterment, as well as several doctorates honoris
causa, and has been inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame.</p>

    <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-adds-pureos-to-list-of-endorsed-gnu-linux-distributions-1</link>
    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Thursday, December 21, 2017-- The Free
Software Foundation (FSF) today announced the addition of PureOS to
its list of recommended GNU/Linux distributions.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<table width="205" align="right" style="background-color: #EEEEEE; text-align: center; margin:10px; border: none !important;  padding: 0px;">

<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html">The FSF's list</a> showcases GNU/Linux operating system distributions
whose developers have made a commitment to follow its <a href="https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-system-distribution-guidelines.html">Guidelines for
Free System Distributions</a>. Each one includes and endorses
exclusively free "as in freedom" software.</p>
<p>After extensive evaluation and many iterations, the FSF concluded that
<a href="https://pureos.net/">PureOS</a>, a modern and user-friendly Debian-derived distribution,
meets these criteria.</p>
<p>"The FSF's high standards for distributions help users know which ones
will honor their desire to be fully in control of their computers and
devices. These standards also help drive the development work needed
to make the free world's tools more practical and powerful than the
proprietary dystopia exemplified by Windows, iOS, and Chrome. PureOS
is living -- and growing -- proof that you can meet ethical standards
while also achieving excellence in user experience," said John
Sullivan, FSF's executive director.</p>
<p>"PureOS is a GNU operating system that embodies privacy, security, and
convenience strictly with free software throughout. Working with the
Free Software Foundation in this multi-year endorsement effort
solidifies our longstanding belief that free software is the nucleus
for all things ethical for users. Using PureOS ensures you are using
an ethical operating system, committed to providing the best in
privacy, security, and freedom," said Todd Weaver, Founder &amp; CEO of
Purism.</p>
<table width="405" align="right" style="background-color: #EEEEEE; text-align: center; margin:10px; border: none !important;  padding: 0px;">

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>FSF's licensing and compliance manager, Donald Robertson, added, "An
operating system like PureOS is a giant collection of software, much
of which in the course of use encourages installation of even more
software like plugins and extensions. Issues are inevitable, but the
team behind PureOS worked incredibly hard to fix everything we
identified. They didn't just fix the issues for their own distribution
-- they sent fixes upstream, and are developing new extension 'store'
mechanisms that won't recommend nonfree software to users. Our
endorsement means we are confident not just in the current state of
affairs, but also in the team's commitment to quickly address any
problems that do arise."</p>
<p>PureOS is developed through a combination of volunteer contributions
and work funded by the company Purism. The FSF's announcement today is
about the PureOS distribution, which can be installed by users on many
kinds of computers and devices. It is not a certification of any
particular hardware shipping with PureOS. Any such endorsements will
be announced separately as part of the FSF's <a href="https://fsf.org/ryf">Respects Your
Freedom</a> device certification program.</p>

<h1>About the GNU Operating System and Linux</h1>
<p>Richard Stallman announced in September 1983 the plan to develop a
free software Unix-like operating system called GNU. GNU is the only
operating system developed specifically for the sake of users'
freedom. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html">https://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>
<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for
one, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under
the GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux
formed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for
the first time to run a PC without nonfree software. This combination
is the GNU/Linux system. For more explanation, see
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html">https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html</a>.</p>

    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, October 31st, 2017 -- The Free
Software Foundation today announced its participation as a beneficiary
charity in the 2017 Combined Federal Campaign, the workplace giving
campaign for United States federal government employees.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) is the world's largest annual
workplace giving campaign, allowing US federal civilian, postal, and
military employees to pledge donations to nonprofit charities such as
the Free Software Foundation (FSF). Last year, federal employees
voluntarily participating in the CFC contributed more than $167
million to charitable causes.</p>
<p>The FSF's work relies on thousands of individual supporters and
members across the United States and around the world, who contribute,
on average, less than $200 each. "We know there are many free software
supporters working in the US federal government," said FSF executive
director John Sullivan. "We're glad they will have this new way to
contribute to the free software movement."</p>
<p>Pledges to support the FSF through the Combined Federal Campaign can
be made by <a href="https://cfcgiving.opm.gov/offerings">designating the Free Software Foundation as the
beneficiary charity</a>. The FSF's CFC identification code is 63210. Donors can pledge until the end of the campaign period on
January 12, 2018.</p>

    <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/new-fsf-membership-benefit-libreoffice-certification</link>
    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Wednesday, September 20th, 2017 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced that the opportunity to apply for LibreOffice certification for migrations and trainings is now available to FSF Associate Members.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Wednesday, September 20th, 2017 -- The
Free Software Foundation (FSF) today announced that the opportunity to
apply for LibreOffice certification for migrations and trainings is
now available to FSF Associate Members.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> is a free software project of <a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/">The Document
Foundation (TDF)</a>, a non-profit based in Germany. An office suite,
LibreOffice encompasses word processing, and programs for the creation
and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, databases, diagrams and
drawings, and mathematical formulae. It uses the ISO standard
OpenDocument file format (ODF).</p>
<p>"LibreOffice is widely used, effectively fulfills a crucial free
software need, and its robust community has made it even better in
just a few years' time. Using LibreOffice gets many people started
down the path of free software," said FSF executive director John
Sullivan. "We admire The Document Foundation's steadfast commitment to
free software principles."</p>
<p>In 2015, TDF began offering <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/certification/">LibreOffice certification</a> to certify
"individuals actively promoting LibreOffice deployments, thanks to their
 competence in specific areas" including development and L3
support, migrations to LibreOffice, and LibreOffice training. </p>
<p>People who are certified in LibreOffice migrations and trainings are
able to help companies and government offices make the switch away
from proprietary office suites, and that raises the value of a deep
understanding of LibreOffice. Previously, certification was only
available to TDF Members and active LibreOffice project members. Italo
Vignoli, Chair of the LibreOffice Certification Committee, said, "By
extending LibreOffice certification to FSF members, we are widening
the reach of our program to foster migrations to LibreOffice. In
several geographies, the availability of certified professionals has
triggered a number of large deployments in public administrations and
enterprises."</p>
<p>FSF members can learn more about the program at
<a href="https://www.documentfoundation.org/certification/program/">https://www.documentfoundation.org/certification/program/</a> and fill
out the application form at

<p>Fans of software freedom can <a href="https://my.fsf.org/join">become an FSF Associate Member</a> for
as little as $10/month or $5/month for students. Membership comes with
<a href="https://fsf.org/associate/benefits">an array of benefits</a>, including the opportunity to become
certified in LibreOffice migrations and trainings, and supports the
FSF and the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>.</p>

    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, September 19, 2017 -- The Free
Software Foundation (FSF) today announced the dates of the tenth
annual LibrePlanet free software conference, which will be held March
24-25, 2018, in the Boston area. </description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://my.fsf.org/lp-call-for-sessions">call for proposals</a> is open
now, until November 2, 2017. <a href="https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&amp;id=71">General registration</a> and <a href="https://libreplanet.org/2018/sponsors/">exhibitor
and sponsor registration</a> are also open.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.libreplanet.org/2018">LibrePlanet</a> is an annual conference for free software enthusiasts
and anyone who cares about the intersection of technology and social
justice. For the past nine years, LibrePlanet has brought together
free software developers, policy experts, activists, hackers,
students, and people who are at the beginning of their free software
journeys. LibrePlanet 2018 will feature programming for all ages and
experience levels.</p>
<p>LibrePlanet's 10th anniversary theme is "Freedom. Embedded." Embedded
systems are everywhere, in cars, digital watches, traffic lights, and
even within our bodies.</p>
<p>"Proprietary software is everywhere, its sinister aspects woven
throughout the devices permeating our lives," said John Sullivan, FSF
executive director. "We need to reverse the new norm that whomever
sold us a device gets to embed their control over us in it forever --
instead, we need freedom embedded."</p>
<p>In a society reliant on embedded systems, how do we defend computer
user freedom? How do we insist on copylefted code, protect ourselves
against government and corporate surveillance, and move toward a freer
world? For many people, digital freedom seems like a pipe dream. Can
the free software community change the narrative and make free
software the norm, instead of walled gardens, denial of the right to
repair, and digital restrictions management (DRM)?</p>
<h4>Call for Sessions</h4>
<p>"The tenth LibrePlanet conference is a great time to think big," said
Georgia Young, program manager at the FSF. "We hope session proposals
will try to bring the free software movement to the next level,
inviting in new ideas and welcoming a broad range of people to the
movement."</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://my.fsf.org/lp-call-for-sessions">Call for sessions applications</a> are currently being accepted and
are due by Thursday, November 2nd, 2017 at 10:00 EDT (14:00 UTC).</strong></p>
<h4>About LibrePlanet</h4>
<p>LibrePlanet is the annual conference of the Free Software
Foundation. What was once a small gathering of FSF members has grown
into a larger event for anyone with an interest in the values of
software freedom. LibrePlanet is always gratis for <a href="https://my.fsf.org/join">associate
members</a> of the FSF. To sign up for announcements about LibrePlanet

    <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Tuesday, August 1, 2017 -- The Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced today that the Seattle GNU/Linux (SeaGL) Conference will join the Working Together for Free Software Fund, becoming the first conference fiscally sponsored by the FSF.</description>
    <content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.fsf.org/working-together/fund">Working Together for Free Software Fund</a>, the FSF provides fiscal sponsorship for a number of important free software and GNU technical projects, such as the GNU Toolchain and Replicant. Today, <a href="http://seagl.org">SeaGL</a> becomes the first event to receive this sponsorship.</p>
<p>SeaGL is a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading awareness and knowledge about the GNU/Linux community, free software, and freedom-respecting hardware. Their interest in free software extends to how they manage the conference, using tools like Jekyll and OSEM, and making sure that nonfree software is not required for attendee registration. In 2016, SeaGL had an attendance of more than 300.</p>
<p>"SeaGL educates new contributors about free software values and provides a friendly forum for community members to share news and tips about free software tools. We can't imagine an organization more in line with our goals than the FSF," said SeaGL board member Deb Nicholson.</p>
<p>As a fiscal sponsor, the FSF will assist SeaGL by providing services required by a legal entity, including the signing of contracts and receiving and processing payments.</p>
<p>"We have always been impressed with the Seattle GNU/Linux Conference's dedication to free software," said John Sullivan, executive director of the FSF and prior speaker at SeaGL. "We are excited to support what they are doing. Conferences are invaluable for building momentum and community within free software."</p>
<p>The FSF has already been represented at SeaGL for several years. FSF staff and volunteers have run an expo table. Richard Stallman, FSF founder, delivered a keynote in 2014. Past speakers include FSF board of directors members Benjamin Mako Hill and Bradley Kuhn. Staff members Donald Robertson III, Georgia Young, and Molly de Blanc have also spoken at the event.</p>
